# Parkinson-Disease-prediction-and-Model-Optimization-Using-sklearn-and-statsmodel-Library
A linear regression model approach to predict people with Parkinson disease using Response Variables (the motor and the total UPDRS scoresassigned by a physician to people with Parkinson’s Disease.)
In this project, we commenced on a data analysis journey which started with the descriptive analytics that helps us to understand the data and its distribution by applying various operation using Pandas and Numpy Library. After the data processig and analyzing, we delve ourself into the making of a linear regression model using acoustic data form patients and comparing that model  with a baseline model. Then applying different train-test spilt ratio into the model and comparing between two response variable. Then our journey to optimized the model started with log transformation and collinearity analysis to observe outliers, removing noise and finding highly collinear features. To optimized the model one step further, we decided to build another regression model using stats model rather than the previous model which we bulit using the sklearn libraries. Using statsmodels, Standardization and Transformtion (Yeo-Johnson Power Transformation) was done to our explanatory variables and  noticed improvement to  our model's performance, as evidenced by higher R-squared (R²) and Adjusted R-squared (Adjusted R²) values. This constructive approach demonstrates the power of feature transformation techniques, addressing non-Gaussianity while preserving interpretability using sklearn and statsmodels library in Python.
